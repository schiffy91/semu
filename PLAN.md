# Semu Plan

This file is the goal contract. It supersedes `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, and
everything under `docs/` until milestone 1 replaces them. On every start,
resume, or context compaction, reread this file and the **Status** block at the
bottom before deciding what to do next.

## Vision

One declarative, Nix-built emulation environment that launches every system in
`config/systems/` from ES-DE with correct fullscreen, controls, save/load, and
Start+Select quit-to-frontend, on two production targets:

- `linux-desktop`: the NixOS host FRACTAL-NORTH (RTX 4090, Plasma Wayland,
  Xbox controllers via xone, ROMs at `~/Games/Emulation/ES-DE/ES-DE/ROMs`).
- `steam-deck`: the physical Deck (Game Mode, Steam Input, SD-card ROM layout).

The two targets share the platform string and nothing else by default. Neither
is "linux". Every emulator is built by Nix from a pinned source revision.

## Standing directives

These come from the owner and do not change without an explicit new message:

- One emulator at a time. Get one working end to end, then the next.
- Only Semu-owned files are edited by hand. Emulator-native files are compiled
  output. Never hand-edit generated output to make something pass.
- ROMs, BIOS, keys, firmware, and existing saves under `~/Games/Emulation` are
  read-only. Never delete, move, or rewrite them.
- Agnostic of X11, Wayland, and gamescope in production paths.
- Start+Select at roughly the same time quits the emulator immediately and
  returns to ES-DE.
- One shader/bezel system for everything, but it is built last (milestone 6),
  after every system launches plain.
- Bazzite only after the complete Deck matrix passes.
- Code style: BTRC with the current stdlib, dense class methods, descriptive
  names, no block comments, trailing comments of 5 to 10 words only.

## Audit summary (2026-09-19)

The tree is 42.6k lines of BTRC in `src/` and 32k in `tests/`, last touched
2026-07-23, pinned to BTRC `964ffe7` (2026-07-22). Findings that drive the plan:

- **BTRC drift is small.** Five mechanical edits port the whole tree to the
  current BTRC (see *Port recipe*). The port transpiles, compiles, and emits
  23 config files against the real `config/`. The rewrite is for design, not
  language.
- **52% of `src/` is AppImage packaging and provenance** (`src/generators/
  appimage/**`, ~22k lines). It reimplements appimagetool by hand and re-proves
  properties the Nix store already guarantees. No deployable artifact was ever
  produced. Delete it.
- **The compiler is a JSON validator that writes a build plan nothing reads.**
  It hand-rolls SHA-256, result types, and three JSON accessors. Keep its
  four-stage shape, its settings precedence ladder, and its owned-paths
  boundary as design. Discard the code.
- **`platform: linux` means Steam Deck.** `config/settings/defaults.json` sets
  linux ROM and BIOS roots to `/run/media/deck/SD/...`; `config/input/` has
  only `steam-deck`; `steam_input.btrc` rejects any controller model but the
  Deck. There is no desktop target.
- **The renderer patches ten emulators at exact upstream function bodies**
  and every `rendering.json` says `runtime_proven: false`. The Ryujinx patch
  hardcodes P/Invoke struct sizes. This is the most fragile code in the tree
  and it was built before one ROM ever launched.
- **The input supervisor is 3.5k lines, a third of it self-tests** compiled
  into the production binary. The quit/journal core is about 600 lines.
- **Nix packaging is the best code in the repo**: `overrideAttrs` over nixpkgs
  recipes onto pinned revisions with patches beside them, eval-time
  assertions. Pins are stale (nixpkgs 2025-05-04) and the container build
  passes `--option sandbox false`.
- **Tests:** about a fifth pin exact emulator config keys and hotkeys and are
  the spec for the rewrite. The rest test fakes of the unbuilt AppImage
  pipeline, enforce directory layout, or are orphaned entry points.
- **Ledger state:** 0 of 17 systems accepted, 88 open todo items, the last
  live Deck session captured a black frame.

## What to keep, what to delete

Keep as the declarative source of truth:

- `config/systems/*/{system,shaders,bezels}.json`
- `config/emulators/*/package.json`, `package.nix`, and the patches listed as
  essential: `retroarch/retroarch_commands.patch`,
  `retroarch/retroarch_get_status_null_safety.patch`. Other patches are kept
  in git history and reintroduced only when milestone 6 needs them.
- `config/emulators/*/emulator.json` slices `platforms.<os>.{executable,args,
  state}` and `input.actions`. Drop `aspect_probe`, `doc`, and the
  `profile.json` `compiler.{bindings,line_groups}` DSL; keep the literal file
  bodies and substitute with one generic resolver.
- `config/assets/{shaders,bezels}.json`, `config/assets/bezels/**`,
  `config/assets/esde/templates/*.xml`
- `config/settings/defaults.json` sections, with the Deck paths moved into
  the `steam-deck` target.
- `packaging/nix/emulators.nix`, `render-hook.nix`, `renderer.nix`,
  `visual-assets.nix`, `semu_app.nix`, `checks.nix`, `packaging/esde/package.nix`
- Spec-bearing tests, kept as fixtures for the new contract tests:
  `tests/compiler/emulator_runtime_contract_test.btrc`,
  `retroarch_production_contract_test.btrc`,
  `steam_input_contract_test.btrc`, `esde_contract_test.btrc`,
  `gb_definition_contract_main.btrc`, `melonds_touch_contract_test.btrc`,
  `azahar_touch_contract_test.btrc`, `cemu_production_contract_test.btrc`,
  `standalone_emulator_production_contract_test.btrc`,
  `tests/fixtures/retroarch/*.cfg`
- The only test that ran a real emulator, as the template for all integration
  tests: `tests/integration/retroarch/{run.sh,scenario.sh,runtime.nix,
  synthetic_core.btrc,glass_scenario.sh}`
- From the Deck harness, two facts only: gamescope screenshot type 3 with the
  stabilization loop (`tests/targets/steamdeck/remote_system.btrc:500-528`)
  and the uinput device construction (`uinput_driver.btrc:110-166`).

Design to carry over without the code:

- Pipeline shape: parse, resolve, check, emit (`src/compiler/pipeline.btrc`).
- Settings precedence: `defaults < target < $SEMU_HOME/semu.json <
  $SEMU_HOME/overrides/**/*.json < --settings-json` (`src/lib/merge.btrc`).
- Owned-paths boundary: no symlinks, no traversal, never write into `src/` or
  `config/` (`src/lib/owned_paths.btrc:77-268`), stdlib-backed.
- Target as data with inheritance (`config/targets/*.json`).
- The action ABI record and the quit process-group termination
  (`src/generators/input/action_abi.btrc`, the 250 ms bounded kill in
  `linux_supervisor.btrc`).

Delete: `src/generators/appimage/**`, `src/generators/appimage.btrc`,
`packaging/appimage/**`, `packaging/install/**`, `nixGL` input and
`nixGLRuntime`, `src/generators/rendering/native/**` and
`rendering/retroarch/**` (returns in milestone 6 from history),
`src/generators/{steam_input,sync,settings}.btrc` (return in milestones 5
and 7), `src/generators/input/steam_install.btrc`, `tests/core/tree_audit/**`,
`tests/compiler/source_architecture_contract_test.btrc`,
`tests/compiler/appimage_*`, `tests/targets/steamdeck/**` except the two facts
above, `tests/targets/bazzite/**`, every orphaned `tests/compiler/*_main.btrc`
not wired in `tests/Makefile`, `docs/**`, `AGENTS.md` (replaced), `README.md`
(rewritten).

## Port recipe

To get a compiling baseline of the old tree for extracting generators, apply
to a scratch copy of `src/`:

1. `import std.{a, b}` becomes one line per module: `import Library.A;`
   (`fs` is `FileSystem`, `cli` is `CLI`, `json` is `JSON`, `io` is `IO`,
   the rest capitalize). Relative imports get a trailing semicolon.
2. `JsonValue` becomes `JSONValue`.
3. `CliArgs` becomes `CLIArgs`, `CliCommandLine` becomes `CLICommandLine`.
4. `Directory.entriesBounded(n)` becomes `Directory.entries()`.
5. `sync.btrc` needs a local `HttpFraming` class with `requestTarget`,
   `token`, `headerLine` returning bool. `Library.http_framing` is gone.

Then `btrcpy src/main.btrc -o build/semu.c --strict-imports --no-cache
--no-stdlib` and `cc build/semu.c -std=c11 -o build/semu -lm`.

## Milestones

Each milestone has a done criterion. A milestone is done only when its
criterion is observed, not when its code is written. Do not start the next
milestone's code while the current criterion is unmet, except for bounded
prep that the current milestone needs.

### M1. Reset the repo on current BTRC

- New `src/` written against the current BTRC stdlib (`Library.JSON`,
  `Library.FileSystem`, `Library.Process`, `Library.Digest`, `Library.Map`,
  `Library.Result`, `Library.CLI`). No hand-rolled hashing, result types, or
  JSON accessors.
- Modules: `model` (typed records loaded from `config/`), `resolve` (target
  inheritance, settings ladder), `check` (one diagnostic list with file, field,
  message), `emit` (ES-DE files, emulator profiles), `launch` (argv, env,
  process group, quit chord), `cli`. Keep each under about 500 lines.
- `config/targets/linux-desktop.json` and `steam-deck.json`. Desktop ROM root
  defaults to `${home}/Games/Emulation/ES-DE/ES-DE/ROMs`; the Deck keeps its
  SD-card paths. BIOS, keys, and firmware are read from the existing
  per-emulator directories under `~/Games/Emulation` on the desktop.
- Apply the keep/delete lists. Replace `AGENTS.md` with a short file that
  points here. Rewrite `README.md` for the two targets.
- `flake.nix`: BTRC follows the same input as `/etc/nixos`; nixpkgs pinned to
  a release branch; the sandbox stays on.
- Tests: `make test` runs the ported contract tests against the new emitters.
- **Done when:** `make build && make test` pass on this host in under one
  minute and `build/semu build configs --target linux-desktop` emits ES-DE and
  RetroArch files with no Deck path in them.

### M2. Game Boy from ES-DE on the desktop

- Stock nixpkgs `retroarch` with `libretro.gambatte`, no source patches.
- Emit `es_systems.xml`, `es_find_rules.xml`, `es_settings.xml`,
  `retroarch.cfg` for `linux-desktop`. Keys from
  `retroarch_production_contract_test.btrc`: `-f`, `video_fullscreen = "true"`,
  `input_quit_gamepad_combo = "0"`, `input_driver = "sdl2"`, autoconfig toast
  suppressed, `network_cmd_enable = "true"` on port 55355.
- A flake package `semu` that wraps ES-DE and the launcher shims, and a module
  `nix/apps/gaming/semu/default.nix` in `/etc/nixos` gated on
  `settings.apps.semu.enable`, mirroring `steam.nix`: `runuser` activation
  that runs `semu prepare --target linux-desktop`, a desktop entry, persisted
  paths for `~/ES-DE` and the emulator config and save roots.
- Start+Select quit through the launcher's process-group kill, both chord
  orders, 250 ms window. Save state and load state on the generated hotkeys.
- **Done when:** on FRACTAL-NORTH, from a cold boot, ES-DE opens from the app
  menu, a real Game Boy ROM launches fullscreen with the Xbox pad, save then
  load restores state, Start+Select returns to ES-DE, and a reboot keeps the
  ES-DE settings and the save state.

### M3. Every RetroArch system on the desktop

- gbc, gba, nes, snes, genesis, n64, psx as primaries; nds (desmume), psp
  (ppsspp), dreamcast (flycast) as fallback cores. All driven by
  `config/systems/*/system.json`; no system id in BTRC.
- One headless integration test per system in the `tests/integration/
  retroarch` style: Xorg dummy plus llvmpipe inside a Nix check, real core,
  the smallest real ROM available, assert nonblank frame, save/load, and that
  the UDP quit returns exit 0 with no orphan processes.
- **Done when:** one real ROM per system launches from ES-DE on the desktop
  with the same hotkeys, and the integration checks pass in `nix flake check`.

### M4. Native emulators on the desktop, one at a time

Order: dolphin (gc, wii), pcsx2, ppsspp, flycast, melonds, azahar, cemu,
ryujinx. For each:

- Refresh the pin in `package.json` to a current release, rebuild through
  `package.nix`, drop the rendering patch.
- Emit the profile from the keys in `emulator_runtime_contract_test.btrc`
  and the per-emulator contract tests. Quit and save hotkeys through the
  emulator's own config where it supports them; a source patch only where it
  does not, and then the smallest possible one.
- An integration test in the M3 style where the emulator can run headless;
  where it cannot, a launch-and-quit test that checks the process tree.
- **Done when:** one real ROM per system launches from ES-DE on the desktop,
  fullscreen, with pad input, save/load where the emulator supports it, and
  Start+Select quit. Sixteen of seventeen systems are then desktop-complete
  (switch counts as done when Ryujinx boots a real title with the existing
  keys and firmware).

### M5. Steam Deck delivery

- Delivery is the Nix closure the old runtime builder already produced,
  shipped as a relocatable tarball plus a 20-line launcher shim. No hand-rolled
  AppImage. If a single-file artifact is later required, use
  `nixpkgs.appimageTools`, not custom code.
- Installer: verify sha256, extract to a digest-named release directory,
  switch a stable symlink, keep one previous release, `rollback` swaps back.
  ES-DE and the launchers resolve through the stable path. FUSE is not
  required.
- `config/input/steam-deck/`: Steam Input profile for the Deck controller
  with the binding table from `steam_input_contract_test.btrc`, published
  into Steam's directories with the existing atomic publish logic trimmed to
  what is needed.
- Deck harness: SSH deploy, gamescope screenshot type 3, uinput driver. Keep
  it under 1k lines.
- Accept on hardware in the M3 then M4 order, one system at a time, gated by
  the desktop integration tests passing on the same revision.
- **Done when:** every system that is desktop-complete launches from ES-DE in
  Game Mode on the physical Deck with pad input, save/load, and Start+Select
  quit, from one installed release, with a screenshot per system retained
  under `build/verification/steam-deck/<release>/`.

### M6. Unified shader and bezel renderer

- One shared library using librashader, exposing the two-hook ABI: after game
  pixels, before emulator UI; after emulator UI, before present.
- RetroArch first, using the hook patch from git history, then one native
  emulator to prove the model, then the rest one at a time. Evaluate whether
  the `GPU` and `SurfaceRenderer` groups in the BTRC stdlib can host the
  compositor before writing GL by hand.
- Bezel and shader selection from `config/systems/*/{shaders,bezels}.json`
  and `config/assets/*`, exposed as settings, with the Game Boy 18-case matrix
  from `gb_definition_contract_main.btrc` as the first visual test.
- **Done when:** the Game Boy row shows the default shader and bezel on both
  targets with inspected screenshots, and toggling to disabled and to one
  alternate works from settings without a rebuild.

### M7. Extras

ES-DE settings menu, Syncthing save sync, Steam shortcuts on the Deck. Each
returns from git history as its own milestone with its own done criterion.
None may block M1 to M6.

## Verification rules

- A contract test asserts exact generated bytes or keys against the
  spec-bearing fixtures. An integration test launches a real emulator. A
  milestone needs both where the emulator can run headless.
- Never mark a criterion met from a passing fixture, a package build, or an
  uninspected screenshot. Say what was observed and on which host.
- Before any deploy to the Deck, the same revision's desktop tests must pass.
- Commit only coherent passing checkpoints. Push after each milestone.

## Status

Update this block whenever a milestone criterion changes state.

- M1 reset: done 2026-09-19 (`make build && make test` pass in about ten
  seconds with 79 checks; `build configs --target linux-desktop` emits ES-DE
  and RetroArch files with no Deck path; `nix flake check --no-build` passes;
  commit eb909a7)
- M2 Game Boy on desktop: in progress
- M3 RetroArch systems on desktop: 0 of 11
- M4 native emulators on desktop: 0 of 8
- M5 Steam Deck: 0 of 17 systems
- M6 renderer: not started
- M7 extras: not started
- Active milestone: M1
- Last observed result: 2026-09-19 audit. Old tree ports to current BTRC with
  the port recipe and emits configs; no ROM has ever launched through Semu on
  any target.
